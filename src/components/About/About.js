        <p>
          Hi, I’m Karen and I love drawing peoples pets. For the past 38 years I
          have worked as a Paediatric nurse at Addenbrookes, Great Ormond street
          and the Luton and Dunstable hospital. However I have always loved
          drawing and through the years I’ve drawn many pictures of staff and
          over the last two years I’ve turned my hand to pet portraits. I have
          drawn many pictures which you can view in the{" "}
          <NavLink className="inline-link inline-link-blue" to="/gallery">
            <strong> gallery</strong>
          </NavLink>{" "}
          and I work on a{" "}
          <NavLink className="inline-link inline-link-blue" to="/prices">
            <strong> comission basis</strong>
          </NavLink>{" "}
          . So if you would like a picture drawn of a special pet for yourself
          or a special present just take a look through my website and{" "}

            className="inline-link inline-link-blue"
            to="contact"

            <strong>contact me</strong>
          </Link>
          . I tend to use mediums such graphite, charcoal or coloured pencil.
